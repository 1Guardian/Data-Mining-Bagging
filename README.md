# Data-Mining-Bagging
This project shows how to use Bagging and Boosting methods to create decision trees to predict the classification of a given data point.

The end of the project also has an implementation of Boosting, but this work is not my own and is my lab partner's work, who is credited in the header of the pdf.

The project is in a pdf version of the ipynb for easier viewing by anyone
